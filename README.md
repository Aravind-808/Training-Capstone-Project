# Hello There!
I did this project and training in my first year of college (June to July 2024) and this was my first exposure to machine learning concepts and being in a professional environment! 
It was so fun getting to meet these amazing people in the office who were more than willing to help, and gave me a glimpse into what work life would be like if I got into the right environment.

Overall, 10/10 experience. Explanation about the code is in the report, I had too much fun doing this.
