# Hello There!
I did this project and training in my first year of college, and this was my first exposure to machine learning concepts and training in a professional environment!
Well, theres nothing much to say here other than a few errors in the report. 
1. I repeated some lines of code while pasting it in the document, so there will be multiple imports to the same package. pls ignore :)
2. I dont want to fix 1 because its what i submitted to the company, so it wont be fair if I changed it now
